 <description>
  <p>
  Scratch is a programming language that makes it easy to create your own
interactive stories, animations, games, music, and art -- and share your
creations on the web.
  </p><p>
As young people create and share Scratch projects, they learn important
mathematical and computational ideas, while also learning to think
creatively, reason systematically, and work collaboratively.
  </p><p>
This package brings in all of the various subpackages which comprise the
full Scratch distribution.
